# Coding
Practising code

In this section, I am aiming to use a combination of resources to test different parts of code out so that I graduallly learn to understand it better.
I'll be looking at HTML and css to start with, and eventually moving onto other types.
In the past I have used my own knowledge to create a couple of homepages, but I feel that I can do better. The issue in the past is that I have been maintaining the code of the website very irregularly, so even though I understood it at the time that I was writing it, the understanding of it disappears after a while of not working on the sites so it takes me a while to get back into it all.
And so, I'm hoping that I can use the history of that, by noting down areas of interest and other areas to help.
I'll be starting right from the beginning, even though I know quite a bit of it already, so I can start fresh.

Wish me luck!
